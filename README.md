# Wavelet-Image-Denoising

We propose a novel Wavelet image denoising method that incorporates dimension reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) and
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our method aims to achieve high de-noise
performance with reduced computational complexity and memory requirements.
